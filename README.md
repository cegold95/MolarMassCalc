MolarMassCalc

Calculator to molar mass of an element - Final Proj APCSII 2013

This is a program I created as the final for my AP Computer Science class in my Junior Year of High School.  

It computes the Molar Mass of given elements.  To test it out, run either run.py or FinalProj.jar, try H2O1 and see what you get and take it from there.
